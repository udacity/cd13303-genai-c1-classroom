# Applications of Generative AI - Exercises

This directory contains hands-on exercises for learning how to apply generative AI to real-world software development problems. The exercises focus on practical implementation of LLM-assisted coding workflows.

## Exercise: LLM-Assisted Merge Sort Workshop

### Overview
In this exercise, you will collaborate with a large language model to implement a Python merge sort algorithm and accompanying test suite. The goal is to practice iterative refinement of AI-generated code while documenting the entire process.
