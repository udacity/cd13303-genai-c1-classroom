# Implementing Neural Networks Using PyTorch - Exercises

This directory contains hands-on exercises for building and training neural networks using PyTorch. The exercises focus on implementing various network architectures and optimization techniques.

## Exercise: Optimizer Bakeoff

### Overview
In this exercise, you will implement and compare different optimization algorithms (SGD, Adam, RMSprop, etc.) on various neural network architectures. You'll analyze convergence behavior, training speed, and final performance to understand when to use different optimizers.
