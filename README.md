# Purpose of This Repo

This repo is meant to be used to keep things organized during content development and act as the source of truth for all projects and exercises related to this course.

## Folder Structure

### module Folder

This repo contains a folder for each `module` and one `project` folder.

Example
```
module-1-hello
module-2-world
module-3-foo
module-4-bar
project
```

Each `module` folder is named using the naming convention of `module-#-name-of-module`.

Example
```
module-1-hello
```

Four module folders have been provided as a template; However, you may need to add more or possibly use less than four depending on what is needed.

If you require an additional module folder, you can make a copy of the folder and paste it into the root directory.

### Exercises Folder

Each `module` folder contains an `exercises` folder. This `exercises` folder should contain all files and instructions necessary for the exercises along with the solution. The solutions for these exercises will be shared with students. See the `README` in the `exercises` folder for information about folder structure.

### Project Folder

The `project` folder should contain all files and instructions necessary for setup. If possible, a set of instructions should be provided for both Udacity workspaces and a way to work locally (for both MacOS and Windows OS). At a minimum, one set of instructions should be provided. A `README` template has been provided in the project folder. This template layout should be used to write your README.
