# Generating Text Using LLMs - Exercises

This directory contains hands-on exercises for learning text generation techniques using Large Language Models. The exercises focus on implementing various text generation strategies and understanding sampling techniques.

## Exercise: Generating One Token at a Time

### Overview
In this exercise, you will build a text generation system that demonstrates how LLMs produce text token by token. You'll implement different sampling strategies, experiment with generation parameters, and understand the trade-offs between creativity and coherence in generated text.
